COMMAND EXECUTER

This program allows you to execute multiple commands on a list of IP addresses concurrently. It provides a progress bar using the `tqdm` library to track the execution of commands.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- `tqdm` library

Usage:
1. Create a text file containing the IP addresses, with each address on a separate line.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. Enter the filename or path of the IP addresses file when prompted.
4. Enter the commands you want to execute, separated by commas, when prompted.

Example:
Enter the filename/path for the IP addresses file: ip_addresses.txt
Enter the commands (separated by commas): ping -c 4, nslookup

Explanation:
- In the above example, the program expects an IP addresses file named "ip_addresses.txt" in the same directory.
- It will execute two commands on each IP address: "ping -c 4" and "nslookup".
- Progress will be displayed with a progress bar.
- The results will be saved to separate files for each command, named "{command}_output.txt".

Notes:
- Ensure that the IP addresses file and the script are in the same directory.
- Make sure the IP addresses file contains one IP address per line.
- The commands can be any valid shell commands separated by commas.
